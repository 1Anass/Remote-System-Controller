# Remote-System-Controller
This project allows taking control of a remote system. More specifically, it is able to: get the name and version of the remote operating system, take screenshots of the remote system, and reboot the remote system. 
I designed and developed 4 versions of this system, and each time I put in practice a specific concept learned in class. The four versions are:
Remote System Controller using traditional client-server model.
Remote System Controller using traditional REST API and XML-SOAP.
A Javascript Consumer for the system using the concept of promises and asynchronous programming.
A Javascript Consumer for the system using the concept of observables
